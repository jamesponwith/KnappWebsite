# KnappWebsite

This project is a webpage that will be hosted on University of San Diego servers. The Knapp Scholars, Erik and Martin Demaine are visiting the University of San Diego to work with us to explore the boundries of mathematics, computer science, and art.

This project was developed with a combination of HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
